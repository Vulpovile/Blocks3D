# ROBLOX 2005 Recreation Project
## Why are we doing this?
ROBLOX in 2005 was a different game, based around minigames with win and lose conditions rather than a 3D building game. Since this build of the client is presumed lost despite having around 100 users, we have to recreate it. We are using era-appropriate tools for this as well (Visual Studio 2005 and 2005-era compilers), as well as G3D 6.10, the era-appropriate version of the Graphics3D graphics library used by ROBLOX to this day.

## Features
Equivalent to known features of 05 as it stood in October 2005 with the 'Morgan McGuire builds'

## Credits
- Morgan McGuire, creator of G3D - his old pre-2006 website for the only existing colour pictures of 2005 era roblox on the internet, as well as a couple of helpful emails. He assisted roblox development in the 2004-2006 timeframe.
- David Baszucki and Erik Cassel (1967-2013, RIP) - for creating roblox
